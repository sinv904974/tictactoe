# Tic Tac Toe

This project is a tutorial designed for people to learn [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
In this tutorial, we will build an interative [tic-tac-toe game](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010) with React.

The tutorial is divided into several sections:
- Setup for the Tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
- Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.
- Completing the Game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.
- Adding Time Travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup for the tutorial
1. Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. Follow the [installation instructions for Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to make a new project.
```
npx create-react-app tictactoe
```
3. Delete all files in the `src/` folder of the new project
```
cd tictactoe
del *
cd ..
```
4. Add a file named `index.css` in the `src/` folder with [this CSS code](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0100).
5. Add a file named `index.js` in the `src/` folder with [this JS code](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010).
6. Add these three lines to the top of `index.js` in the `src/` folder:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
```

Now we can run `npm start` in the project folder and open `http://localhost:3000` in the broswer.

After we have setup for the tutorial, we can get started by following the [instructions](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
